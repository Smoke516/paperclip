# 🏠 Welcome Screen Improvements

## ✅ Changes Made

### 1. **Always Show Welcome Screen on Startup**
- **Before**: First-time users saw welcome screen, existing users went directly to workspace selection
- **After**: ALL users see the welcome screen on startup
- **Benefit**: Consistent experience, central hub for all users

### 2. **Context-Aware Welcome Options** 
- **First-time users** see:
  ```
  🚀 Get Started             - Create your first todo and jump right in
  📂 Browse Workspaces       - Explore existing workspaces or create new ones  
  ❓ Learn the Basics        - View help and keyboard shortcuts
  ⚡ Quick Demo              - See Paperclip in action with sample todos
  ❌ Exit                    - Close Paperclip
  ```

- **Existing users** see:
  ```
  📂 Browse Workspaces       - Select from your existing workspaces
  ❓ Learn the Basics        - View help and keyboard shortcuts
  ⚡ Quick Demo              - See Paperclip in action with sample todos
  🆕 Create New Workspace    - Start fresh with a new workspace
  ❌ Exit                    - Close Paperclip
  ```

### 3. **Smart "Get Started" Behavior**
- **For first-time users**: Works as before - creates Personal workspace and goes to insert mode
- **For existing users**: "Get Started" option is removed from the menu entirely
- **Benefit**: No confusion, existing users can't accidentally trigger first-time setup

### 4. **Better Welcome Messages**
- **First-time**: "Welcome to Paperclip! Choose an option below to get started."
- **Existing users with todos**: "Welcome back! You have X todos across Y workspaces."
- **Existing users without todos**: "Welcome back! Ready to organize your todos?"

## 🎯 User Experience Flow

### New Users:
1. Launch `paperclip` → See welcome screen
2. Can choose "🚀 Get Started" to jump right in
3. Or explore other options first

### Existing Users:
1. Launch `paperclip` → Always see welcome screen
2. "🚀 Get Started" option is not shown (no confusion)
3. Primary option is "📂 Browse Workspaces" 
4. New option "🆕 Create New Workspace" for starting fresh
5. Can use `Ctrl+H` from anywhere to return to welcome screen
