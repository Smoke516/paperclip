# Paperclip Improvements

This document tracks enhancements made and planned for the Paperclip todo application.

## ‚úÖ Completed Improvements

### 1. **Bug Fixes** (Completed)
- **Due Date Removal Bug**: Fixed issue where removing `due:` syntax from todo description didn't clear existing due dates
- **Parent-Child Relationship Bug**: Fixed issue where deletion of child todos left expansion arrows on parent todos

### 2. **Enhanced Date Parsing** (Completed - Core Implementation)
Enhanced the natural language date parsing with support for:

#### Basic Relative Dates
- `today`, `tomorrow`, `yesterday`
- `monday`, `tuesday`, etc. (next occurrence)
- `eod`, `endofday`, `noon`

#### Advanced Relative Patterns
- `in X days` / `X days` - e.g., `in 3 days`, `5 days`
- `in X weeks` / `X weeks` - e.g., `in 2 weeks`, `1 week`  
- `in X months` / `X months` - e.g., `in 1 month`, `3 months`
- `in X years` / `X years` - e.g., `in 1 year`, `2 years`

#### Smart Weekday Parsing
- `next monday`, `next friday` - next occurrence of that weekday
- `this monday`, `this friday` - occurrence of that weekday in current week

#### Multiple Date Formats
- `2024-12-25` (ISO format)
- `12/25/2024`, `25/12/2024` (US/International)
- `12-25-2024`, `25-12-2024`
- `12/25`, `25/12` (current year assumed)
- `Dec 25`, `December 25` (current year)
- `Dec 25, 2024`, `December 25, 2024`

**Usage Examples:**
```
Buy groceries due:tomorrow
Meeting due:next friday  
Report due:in 3 days
Conference due:2024-12-15
Call mom due:eod
```

## üöß In Progress / Planned Improvements

### 3. **Undo/Redo System** (Partially Implemented)
**Status**: Infrastructure completed, but needs borrowing issue fixes

**Completed:**
- Command history system with 50-command limit
- Command enum for tracking operations (Add, Delete, Complete, Edit, etc.)
- Basic undo/redo framework
- Key bindings: `u` for undo, `Ctrl+R` for redo

**Remaining Work:**
- Fix Rust borrowing conflicts in command execution
- Complete redo operations for all command types
- Add command recording to priority changes and child todo operations

### 4. **Bulk Operations** (Partially Implemented)
**Status**: Framework implemented, but needs borrowing issue fixes

**Completed:**
- Visual mode infrastructure (`V` key to enter)
- Multi-selection with range support
- Bulk operations framework (complete, delete, set priority)
- UI mode indicators

**Remaining Work:**
- Fix Rust borrowing issues in bulk operations
- Complete bulk tag/context operations
- Improve visual selection UI feedback

## üéØ Recommended Next Steps

### Priority 1: Fix Compilation Issues
1. **Resolve borrowing conflicts** in undo/redo system
2. **Resolve borrowing conflicts** in bulk operations
3. **Add missing WorkspaceManager methods** (`get_workspace`, `get_workspace_mut`)

### Priority 2: Complete Core Features
1. **Finish Undo/Redo System**
   - Complete all command types for redo operations
   - Add visual indicators for undo/redo availability
   - Integrate with all existing operations

2. **Complete Bulk Operations**
   - Finish bulk tag/context operations
   - Add visual highlighting for selected todos
   - Add bulk move between workspaces

### Priority 3: Additional High-Impact Features

#### A. Quick Actions & Shortcuts
- Quick priority setting: `1-5` keys to set priority directly
- Quick context/tag assignment: `@` followed by first letter
- Template shortcuts: `Ctrl+1`, `Ctrl+2` for common todo types

#### B. Better Visual Feedback
- Progress bars for parent todos (showing completion percentage of children)  
- Different colors for priority levels
- Icons or symbols for different todo types
- Overdue todos highlighted in red

#### C. Sorting & Grouping Options
- Sort by: priority, due date, creation date, alphabetical
- Group by: context, tag, due date, priority
- Custom sort orders per workspace

#### D. Enhanced Search & Filtering
- Combine filters: `#urgent @work due:today`
- Saved filters/views
- Regular expression search
- Search within notes

## üöÄ Advanced Features (Future)

### Analytics & Insights
- Completion rates over time
- Most used tags/contexts  
- Time tracking summaries
- Productivity metrics

### Import/Export Features
- Export to CSV, Markdown, todo.txt format
- Import from other todo apps
- Backup/restore functionality

### External Integrations
- Git integration: link todos to commits/branches
- Calendar sync (ical/caldav)
- Email integration: create todos from emails

### Configuration System
- Custom key bindings
- Color theme customization
- Default templates and settings
- Per-workspace settings

## üìù Development Notes

### Known Issues
1. **Borrowing Conflicts**: The undo/redo and bulk operations need refactoring to avoid simultaneous mutable borrows of different App struct fields
2. **Missing Methods**: WorkspaceManager needs `get_workspace` and `get_workspace_mut` methods
3. **UI Visual Selection**: Bulk operations need better visual feedback for selected items

### Architecture Improvements Needed
1. **Separate Command System**: Consider moving command history to its own module
2. **Better Error Handling**: More robust error handling throughout the application
3. **Performance**: Optimize for larger todo lists with lazy loading
4. **Testing**: Add comprehensive unit tests for new features

### Code Quality
- The current implementation maintains good separation of concerns
- The date parsing system is extensible and well-structured
- Command system architecture is solid but needs borrowing fixes
- UI system handles new modes gracefully

## üéâ Summary

We've successfully implemented:
- ‚úÖ **Critical bug fixes** for due date removal and parent-child relationships
- ‚úÖ **Comprehensive enhanced date parsing** with natural language support
- üöß **Foundation for undo/redo system** (needs borrowing fixes)
- üöß **Foundation for bulk operations** (needs borrowing fixes)

The application has significantly improved user experience with much better date parsing and critical bug fixes. The next development phase should focus on resolving the borrowing issues to complete the undo/redo and bulk operations features.
